Why i moved to Fedora Linux


Like the different between fedora and Ubuntu and arch is the package managers and stability


Ubuntu is stable but not latest


Arch is latest but unstable


edora is latest but still stable because its not bleeding edge


so i ended up with fedora becouse i like dnf and i like gnome
