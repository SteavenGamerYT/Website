Why i moved to Fedora Linux

Like the different between fedora and Ubuntu and arch is the package managers and stability

Ubuntu is stable but not latest

Arch is latest but unstable

Fedora is latest but still stable because its not bleeding edge

so i ended up with fedora becouse i like dnf and i like gnome
