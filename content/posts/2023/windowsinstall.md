You can create a bootable Windows 10 USB flash drive with multiple tools, and in this guide, I’ll show you how. When a new version of Windows 10 becomes available, not everyone gets the latest release on the same day. Instead, Microsoft upgrades computers gradually, taking some time until the new version reaches every device.

However, if you do not want to wait for the automatic upgrade, the company lets you download the Windows 10 (version 22H2, 21H2, and older releases) installation files using the Media Creation Tool. The tool helps perform an in-place upgrade or create a bootable installation media using a USB flash drive to perform a clean install. Furthermore, you can even use third-party tools like Rufus to download and create a bootable media to install Windows 10 from USB.

This guide will teach you how to create a USB flash drive to upgrade or reinstall Windows 10 on different devices using the Media Creation Tools and Rufus.
