So at frist Lets talk about Why I didnt go with Fedora or Debian or even Ubuntu or others.

SO as we Know that Fedora is way better then Arch for most pepole but i am defernert.

I like to reinstall a lot, distro hop a lot, and arch have kinda fixed that.

Lets say for example i wanted to try Steam os, all i had to do is `yay -S gamescope-session` and bam i got steam os on arch without reinstalling an entire os for testing.

I have gaming laptop and Touch Screen laptop.

Arch with kde have been really well.

## On My gaming laptop
 i only had to install and setup optimus-manager and it works really well only on xorg, wayland is still borked.

## On my Touch screen laptop
 I only had to configure the FULL WAYLAND like for real forcing everything to run as native wayland not that easy, not all apps support it, but when the app support it, its better to run it in native wayland, becouse xorg x11 doesn't support absolute touch.

## Configreing wayland on My gaming laptop
While I have got wayland working a lot of times, in Fedora mostly, None in arch, I dont like fedora, since it doesn't offer everything unlike arch, Like I dont have aur in fedora, What about nix-env?, Nah, It doesn't support Nvidia gpus sadly.

Update: I have fixed Wayland on Arch!

Step 1: Open System Settings.

Step 2: Go to Display and Monitor.

Step 3: Go to Compositor.

Step 4: Change Latency Force smoothest animations from to Balance of latency and smoothness.

## Desktop Environments
While I do like gnome a lot, I have to say Kde is sold, It works so much better then Gnome in most cases.

## Window Managers
While i have configured I3 and Hyprland, Thay have only seem to work on Fedora becouse of my nvidia gpu, Yeah nvidia is so much better on fedora in fact the issue with wayland is nvidia drivers on arch.

## Windows
So what made me to start learning Linux?,

Yes what you see is right!, Its Windows 11 insider black screen of death.

I used to get this a lot, Then you midge ask, Why use Windows 11 Canary or Beta Channel over Stable?, Windows is missing a lot of Features that is only in Canary and sometimes in Beta.

## Gaming on Linux
Well I have made a guide for that its pretty outdated and I will update soon as posable and edit this section.
