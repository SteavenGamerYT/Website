## OS
So why did i chose Debian 12 over Windows and Arch Linux?

### Windows
So at first lets talk about windows, The main resone why i dont use windows right now is

Its too slow.

It have tons of spyware.

It have tons of bloatware.

Its basicly limiting for me.

### Arch Linux
So I did try to use Arch linux but things didnt go as pland.

So at Frist, I had tons of problems with kde on arch linux.

bascily when i try to use the xorg session my system is slow laggy and freezing a lot.

in wayland session every 5 to 20mints kde freezes and requireing me to restart it.

and when i tried to game nothing went as pland, games was blacking out once it ran under 60fps or above 60fps.


So I did install old drivers, did that fix it?, yeah it did, but system started to black out now not games.

So Pepole at bbs.archlinux.org told me to try to use lastest drivers with linux-lts, well that did fix it, but kde was still freezing mess.

so I went with gnome xorg, that have fixed it right?

No, When i tried to do anything expect gaming, it was really not working, and games was crashing when i have mimized them.

So what is the fix you midge ask for all of that issues?

### Debian 12
I have bascily installed a stable distro that is called Debian 12.

I alraday did knew that there is tons of limets when it comes to a distro that doesnt have aur and i alraday knew how to fix that.

Bascily on Debian 12 you can use flatpak and snaps to get apps that you would normaly get from aur on arch linux.

well did everything get sloved?

Well kinda on arch linux i was able to play vkd3d games, on Debian 12 not so much.

Still Debian 12 is working so much better then arch Linux.

For an example, on Arch linux mimizing a game would crash it, yeah same on Debian 12 but i have managed to fix it.

**JUST USE GAMESCOPE**

yes leterily just installing gamescope and running the games that would crash using it, have fixed all of the crashs.

So now we can say i got the best budget pc you can get in 2023 brand new that can run Linux and do Gaming.

## Price

How much did the pc cost?

The pc have costed 20k EGP or 647$, Under 700$!

## Ending
So at the end i really like my new pc.

I just hate that i only have 500gb nvme, prehapfs i am going to upgrade it to 2tb in the feature.
